# Project

## Background
We at OAK Foundation believes Polkadot.js is a critical tool in the Polkadot ecosystem, whose function is to store wallets in browser extension and sign transactions. Therefore, in Substrate Hackathon Mar 2021 we decided to hack the extension code to add below features:

1. Batch import & export wallets with password protected file
1. Address book for regular contacts
1. Onchain identity information integration

## Progress
As to Mar 14th 2021, we have completed all three features planned for this hackathon. We started on mid Feb and the development took us three weeks.
## Video Demo
You can have a preview of our demo on Youtube

## Code
All source code of this project is located at [teams/19-OAK-Foundation/src]
## Chrome Extension Build
We also packed an extension build at [teams/19-OAK-Foundation/build] which could be installed into Chrome directly.
### Installation
1. Type `chrome://extensions/` in the URL address field in Chrome browser. The link will navigate you to Extension Manager.

1. At the top left corner, click on "Load Unpacked", and select the [teams/19-OAK-Foundation/build] folder to include all files under it.
