# Project

## Background
We at OAK Foundation believes Polkadot.js is a critical tool in the Polkadot ecosystem, whose function is to store wallets in browser extension and sign transactions. Therefore, in Substrate Hackathon Mar 2021 we decided to hack the extension code to add below features:

1. Batch import & export wallets with password protected file
1. Address book for regular contacts
1. Onchain identity information integration

## Progress
As to Mar 14th 2021, we have completed all three features planned for this hackathon. We started on mid Feb and the development took us three weeks.
