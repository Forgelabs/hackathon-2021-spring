# Team

## Team Name
OAK Foundation

## Team Description
OAK, or Onchain Automation Framework, is committed to building a Polkadot parallel chain that connects and automates smart contract operations. With Polkadot's cross-chain capability, we will implement several important future functions, including advanced trading such as trailing stop on Ethereum Defi, customer auto-payment, and restake strategy for maximum compound interest.

The team has been deeply involved in blockchain development since 2017, and created Dapps and mobile wallets on Ethereum, EOS, and RSK. Founder Chris Li is a DOT holder since 2017 and deeply believes the cross-chain strategy will take over incumbents in 3 years' time. Participating in this Substrate hackathon this time, we hope to hack code, exchange opinions with other teams, and attract more full-time Rust language developers to build with us together.
