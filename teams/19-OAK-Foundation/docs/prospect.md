# Future Roadmap
In this document we illustrate the future roadmap from two perspectives, the Polkadot.js extension improvement as hackathon project, and a larger blueprint for the OAK foundation.

## Polkadot.js Extension
While we have added three functions to Polkadot.js browser extension, it's only a start. During implementation, we find more nice features to add, for example, the contacts could sorted by most recent order, or most favorite. There are addresses on chains other than Polkadot and Kusama not recognizable by format. In the next two months, we will prioritize with Jaco, the owner of the extension to see what other contributions we can make. In my opinion, the extension is a key piece for Polkadot applications, so making it better will benefit almost all teams in Polkadot.

## OAK Foundation
The goal of OAK Foundation is to enhance cross-chain interoperability to complete complicated tasks. Right now automation on blockchain is a privilege to developers. Not until we democratize those privilege, we won't have a blockchain space where users are equally treated and have trust. We have built a three-year plan to conquer a variety of technical difficulty, something that's new and original. Here I'm listing several key milestones.
